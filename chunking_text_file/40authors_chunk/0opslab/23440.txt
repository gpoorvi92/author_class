 * <p>
 * <b> This class has been replaced by {@link ParsingDetector} and only exists for backward-compatibility.
 * </b> The name simply would not match any more, as parsing is not limited to html (1.1 includes xml as well). New code
 * should stick to the replacement. This class has been modified with version 1.1 and now is delegating all calls to an
 * instance of the replacement class (5 minutes with eclipse and a common interface), which introduces a small overhead
 * (minimal, as one invokevirtual is nothing compared to codepage detection by parsing).
