   * 
   * @param in
   *          An InputStream for the document, that supports mark and a
   *          readlimit of argument length.
   * 
   * @param length
   *          The amount of bytes to take into account. This number should not
   *          be longer than the amount of bytes retrievable from the
   *          InputStream but should be as long as possible to give the fallback
   *          detection (chardet) more hints to guess.
