 * This class provides a way to fill a shape with a radial color gradient
 * pattern.
 * Given an Ellipse and 2 Colors, color1 and color2, the paint will render 
 * a color starting at color1 at the center of the Ellipse to color2 at 
 * its boundary. All pixels lying outside the Ellipse boundary have the
 * color2 value.
