 A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

 Solution: 1. recursive solution. O(n) space. get inorder list first.
           2. recursive solution. O(n) space. with only auxiliary two pointers.
           3. Use a stack. Iteration.
           4. Morris inorder traversal. O(1) space. with only auxiliary two pointers.
