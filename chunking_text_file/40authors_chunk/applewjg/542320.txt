 Problem:    Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 Difficulty: Medium
 Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
 Notes:
 Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
