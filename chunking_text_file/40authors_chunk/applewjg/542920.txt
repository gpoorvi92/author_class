 Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

 You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.

 Solution: 1. Time : O(nlogn). Space : O(1); 
              Sort the unsorted array, and find the maximum difference.
           2. Time : O(n). Space : O(n).
              Drawer Theory. If we put n numbers into (n+1) drawers, 
              then there must be at least one empty drawer.
