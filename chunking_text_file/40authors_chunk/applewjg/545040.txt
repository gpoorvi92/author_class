 Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
 1,2,3 -> 1,3,2
 3,2,1 -> 1,2,3
 1,1,5 -> 1,5,1

 Solution: O(n)
 Processes: Take A = {1,3,2} as an example:
            1. Traverse from back to forth, find the turning point, that is A[i] = 3.
            2. Sort from the turning point to the end (A[i] to A[end]), so {3,2} becomes {2,3}.
            3. If i equals to 0, finish! Else, goto 4.
