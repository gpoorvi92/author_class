 Notes:
 The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

 The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
