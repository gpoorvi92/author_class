 Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

 In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.


 Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

 For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
