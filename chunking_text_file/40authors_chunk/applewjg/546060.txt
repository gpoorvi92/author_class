 Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). 
 You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

 Requirements for atoi:
 The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first 
 non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional
 initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets 
 them as a numerical value.
 The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which 
 are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
