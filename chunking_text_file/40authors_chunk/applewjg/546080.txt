 If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or 
 if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, 
 no conversion is performed.
 If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out 
 of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.

 Solution: 1. To deal with overflow, inspect the current number before multiplication. 
            If the current number is greater than 214748364, we know it is going to overflow.
            On the other hand, if the current number is equal to 214748364, 
            we know that it will overflow only when the current digit is greater than or equal to 8..
