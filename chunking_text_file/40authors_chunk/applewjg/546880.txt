 The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 Solution: Recursion. 1. Add lower & upper bound. O(n)
                      2. Inorder traversal with one additional parameter (value of predecessor). O(n)
