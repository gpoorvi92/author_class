 We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".
 Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

 Solution: 1. Recursion + pruning.
           2. 3-dimensional dp.
              'dp[k][i][j] == true' means string s1(start from i, length k) is a scrambled string of string s2(start from j, length k).
