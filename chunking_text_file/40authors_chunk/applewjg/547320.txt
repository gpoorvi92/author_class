 Problem:    Text Justification
 Difficulty: Hard
 Source:     https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/
 Notes:
 Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L 
 characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
 You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line.
