 Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
 Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces 
 on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more 
 spaces than the slots on the right.
 For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

 For example,
 words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
 L: 16.
 Return the formatted lines as:
