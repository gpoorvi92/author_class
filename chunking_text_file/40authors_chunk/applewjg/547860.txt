 Note:
 You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
 Follow up:
 A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
 First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with 
 total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
 Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

 Solution: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ...... 2 2 2 2
               |         |      |
