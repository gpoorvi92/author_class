 path = "/home/", => "/home"
 path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"

 Corner Cases:
 Did you consider the case where path = "/../"?
 In this case, you should return "/".
 Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as "/home//foo/".
 In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return "/home/foo".

 Solution: Add an additional '/' at the end of 'path' for simply detecting the end.
