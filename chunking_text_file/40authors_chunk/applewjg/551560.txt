 and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.
 Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

 Solution: Although we can only use constant space, we can still exchange elements within input A!
           Swap elements in A and try to make all the elements in A satisfy: A[i] == i + 1.
           Pick out the first one that does not satisfy A[i] == i + 1.
