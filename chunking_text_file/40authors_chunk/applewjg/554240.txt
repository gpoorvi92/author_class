 You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

 Example
 GIven colors=[3, 2, 2, 1, 4], k=4, your code should sort colors in-place to [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]. 

 Challenge
 A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. That will cost O(k) extra memory.

 Can you do it without using extra memory?
