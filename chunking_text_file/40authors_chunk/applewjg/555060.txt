 S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
 T = "ABC"
 Minimum window is "BANC".
 Note:
 If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
 If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique 
 minimum window in S.

 Solution: 1. Use two pointers: start and end. 
              First, move 'end'. After finding all the needed characters, move 'start'.
