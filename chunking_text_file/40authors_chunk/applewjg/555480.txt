 Note:
 All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
 Elements in a combination (a1, a2, .. , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 <= a2 <= ... <= ak).
 The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7, 
 A solution set is: 
 [7] 
 [2, 2, 3] 

 Solution: Sort & Recursion.
