 s1 = "aabcc",
 s2 = "dbbca",
 When s3 = "aadbbcbcac", return true.
 When s3 = "aadbbbaccc", return false.

 Solution: 1. dp. O(MN) time & space. 'dp[i][j] == true' means that there is at least one way to construct 
              the string s3[0...i+j-1] by interleaving s1[0...j-1] and s2[0...i-1].
