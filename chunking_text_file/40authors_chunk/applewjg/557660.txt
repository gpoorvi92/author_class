 Note:
 All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
 Elements in a combination (a1, a2, .. , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 <= a2 <= ... <= ak).
 The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 For example, given candidate set 10,1,2,7,6,1,5 and target 8, 
 A solution set is: 
 [1, 7] 
 [1, 2, 5] 
 [2, 6] 
 [1, 1, 6]
