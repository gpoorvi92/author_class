     * Static initializer.
     * Creates the manager by getting the property 
     * JPOS_SERVICE_MANAGER_CLASS_PROP_NAME.  If this property is not defined 
     * then defaults to the SimpleServiceManager 
     * NOTE: since the JposServiceManager interface was moved to the 
     * jpos.loader package then we define 2 property to specify the custom
     * serviceManager one with the previous jpos.config prefix and the other 
     * with the correct jpos.loader prefix
     * @see jpos.util.JposProperties#JPOS_SERVICE_MANAGER_CLASS_PROP_NAME
