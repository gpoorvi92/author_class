     * This method is used to build a request with the specified payload placed
     * into the insertion point. There is no requirement for extension-provided
     * insertion points to adjust the Content-Length header in requests if the
     * body length has changed, although Burp-provided insertion points will
     * always do this and will return a request with a valid Content-Length
     * header.
     * <b>Note:</b>
     * Scan checks should submit raw non-encoded payloads to insertion points,
