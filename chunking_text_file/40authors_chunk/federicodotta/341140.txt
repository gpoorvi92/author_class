    /**
     * The Scanner invokes this method when the custom Scanner check has
     * reported multiple issues for the same URL path. This can arise either
     * because there are multiple distinct vulnerabilities, or because the same
     * (or a similar) request has been scanned more than once. The custom check
     * should determine whether the issues are duplicates. In most cases, where
     * a check uses distinct issue names or descriptions for distinct issues,
     * the consolidation process will simply be a matter of comparing these
     * features for the two issues.
