/**
 * Provides identification for JLFU API.<br>
 * The default implementation ({@link DefaultIdentifierProvider}) is using a cookie to store a UUID
 * generated for every client.<br>
 * You can provide your own implementation to be able to manage this identification using a more
 * complex system (if you want users to resume files from another browser or provide ids linked to a
 * job instead of a client if you are providing upload in a more sequential way).
