 * This is an example Hadoop Map/Reduce application derived from Apache Hadoop examples.
 * It reads the input files, breaks each line into words, checks to see if words are part
 * of proper (human) names) and counts them. The output is a sorted list of human names
 * that occur some minumum number of times in the inpup files.

 * To run:
 * <p/>
 * bin/hadoop jar namefinder.jar namefinder [-m <i>maps</i>] [-r <i>reduces</i>] <i>in-dir</i> <i>out-dir</i>
