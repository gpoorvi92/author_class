/**
 * This class provides several utilities to cancel bitmap decoding.
 *
 * The function decodeFileDescriptor() is used to decode a bitmap. During
 * decoding if another thread wants to cancel it, it calls the function
 * cancelThreadDecoding() specifying the Thread which is in decoding.
 *
 * cancelThreadDecoding() is sticky until allowThreadDecoding() is called.
