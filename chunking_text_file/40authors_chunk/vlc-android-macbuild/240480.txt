import android.widget.TabHost;

/**
 * This is a helper class that implements a generic mechanism for associating
 * fragments with the tabs in a tab host. It relies on a trick. Normally a tab
 * host has a simple API for supplying a View or Intent that each tab will show.
 * This is not sufficient for switching between fragments. So instead we make
 * the content part of the tab host 0dp high (it is not shown) and the
 * TabManager supplies its own dummy view to show as the tab content. It listens
 * to changes in tabs, and takes care of switch to the correct fragment shown in
