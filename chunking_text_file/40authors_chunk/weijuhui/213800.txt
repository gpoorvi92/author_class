     * This method adds "val" time units (where a time unit is the amount of time that
     * separates one TimeView generated by this labeler from the next -- e.g. if this
     * labeler is producing TimeViews each representing a day, then a time unit would
     * be a single day) to the specified time and returns a TimeObject representing
     * the result.
     *
     * This method will be called constantly, whenever new date information is required.
